# Assignment 1

## Stakeholders

- Customer: JAMK
- Management: Project management
- JAMK representative (and JAMK management)
- Developers
- Designers
- End user: Teachers and students of JAMK, librarians

## Feasibility study

Funds allocated from the client JAMK Central Management for the project is 300 000 â‚¬. Client expects complete design and development of the system.

The end product of the project will be a web application. It is required to have complete usability on computers as well as on mobile devices. As the end-users of the site will be students and teachers of JAMK, JAMK login credentials must be used for log in on the website. On the site, users can loan, reserve or extend the loan time of a book while logged in. Also new functionality for borrowing e-books must be included. 

Project will be a full stack development project with front- and back-end functionality. A database solution must be developed in order to save the data about the books, users, and loans. Security of the site is a high priority for the client as the user information must not be leaked under any circumstances. Robustness is expected as the max load of site will be in hundreds of simultaneous users.

In the usage of user data, European Union's General Data Protection Regulation must be considered.

Expected schedule of the project is still unclear.

System will be "self-documenting" in a way that it will not require any extra knowledge to use it. The goal is to make the UI self explanatory.

##### 2.6 Assumptions and dependencies

Assumptions
- Website must run flawlessly on deployment
- Easy to use for users
- Users may access the page from computer or mobile devices
- 

Dependencies
- JAMK's login system is assumed to be embedded on the site for login.
- Information of items and users will be stored on a database

#### 3 System features

##### 3.1 Functional requirements

###### 3.1.1 Functional requirement 1
