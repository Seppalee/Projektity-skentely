According to feedback, the graphical layout looks nice and the thematical uniformity is a nice touch. Menus are easy to navigate. 

Points for improvement in feedback are:
- Select difficulty options could be made bigger, since it looks little awkward next to the big buttons under it. 
- In preferences, there is quite a bit empty space so it could be made tighter fit. 
- Load game screen could result in accessibility trouble with the alpha on buttons, so the clarity on that could be improved.
